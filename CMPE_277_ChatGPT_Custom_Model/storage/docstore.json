Californian, \nWhether traveling by car, transit, bike, scooter, \nskateboard or on foot, we all want to reach our \ndestination safely. Tragically, many Californians do \nnot.\nSince 2010, more than 30,000 people have been \nkilled and another 100,000 people seriously \ninjured on California roads. This deadly trend \nis getting worse, especially for people walking or biking. We\u2019ve seen \na nearly 50 percent rise in annual deaths and serious injuries for \npedestrians and greater than 60 percent increase in bicyclists killed per \nyear since 2010.\nUnlike those of us traveling in vehicles with seat belts, airbags and other \nsafety features, people outside of vehicles don\u2019t have the same level \nof protection and are more vulnerable every time they are on the road. \nTheir safety must always be top of mind when we\u2019re driving.\nCalifornia is doing everything possible to implement comprehensive \ntraffic safety measures to eliminate deaths and serious injuries on our \nroadways. It includes strategies to reduce our dependence on driving, \nto the way we design roads and intersections, to expanding safe walking \nand biking options. \nBut we need your help. Without all of us practicing safe driving habits, \nthese avoidable tragedies will continue to occur. Please make sure to \nbuckle up, follow all traffic laws, pay extra attention to pedestrians and \nbicyclists, and do not drive if you\u2019re distracted or impaired. \nI hope the information in this California Driver\u2019s Handbook can help \neveryone on the road \u2013 drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians \u2013 reach their \ndestination safely. Because it\u2019s about more than just learning the rules of \nthe roads. It could be a matter of life and death.\nWishing you safe journeys,\nToks Omishakin  \nSecretary  \nCalifornia State Transportation Agency\n\niiCopyright\n\u00a9 Copyright, Department of Motor Vehicles 2023\nAll rights reserved.This work is protected by U.S. Copyright Law.

Do not drive on or over this barrier, make a left turn, \nor make a U-turn across it, except at designated openings.\nBroken Yellow Line\nA broken yellow line indicates you may pass if the broken line is next to \nyour driving lane. Only pass when it is safe.\nSingle Solid White Line\nA single solid white line marks traffic lanes going in the same direction. \nThis includes one-way streets.\n\n16Double Solid White Lines\nDouble solid white lines indicate a lane barrier between a regular use \nand a preferential use lane, such as a carpool (HOV) lane. You may also \nsee double solid white lines in or near freeway on and off ramps. Never \nchange lanes over double solid white lines.

The triangles point towards \napproaching vehicles. \n\n17Choosing a Lane \n:Traffic lanes are often \nr\neferred to by number. The \nleft (or fast) lane is called the Number 1 Lane. The lane to the right of the Number 1 Lane is called the Number 2 Lane. Then the Number 3 Lane, etc.\nHere are some tips for choosing a lane\n\u2022 Use the left lane to pass or turn left. \n\u2022 Use the right lane to enter or exit traffic.\nChanging Lanes\nBefore you change lanes:\n\u2022 Signal.\n\u2022 Check your mirrors.\n\u2022 Check traffic behind and beside you.\n\u2022 Look over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move to make \nsure the lane is clear.\n\u2022 Check your blind spots for other vehicles, motorcyclists, and bicyclists. Do not let the vehicle drift into another lane.\n\u2022 Be sure there is enough space for your vehicle in the next lane. It is not necessary to slow down before a lane change.\nStay in one lane as much as possible. Do not weave in and out of traffic. Last minute lane or direction changes may increase the risk of collisions. Once you start moving through an intersection, keep going. If you start to make a turn, follow through. If you miss a turn, keep driving until you can safely and legally turn around.\nTypes of Lanes\nPassing Lanes\nOn a multilane road, the passing lane (far left lane) is the lane closest to the center divider and is used to pass other vehicles. \nCarpool/High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes\nAn HOV lane is a special lane reserved for carpools, buses, motorcycles, or low-emission vehicles with decals. To use an HOV lane, one of these must apply:\nExample of numbered traffic lanes.\n\n18\u2022 You have a certain number of people in your vehicle. There will be \nsigns at the on-ramp or along the road to tell you the minimum number of people. Road signs also list the hours when the HOV rules apply.\n\u2022 You are driving a low emission or zero emission vehicle. You must display a special DMV-issued decal. \n\u2022 You are riding a motorcycle (unless otherwise posted).\nThe road surface in a HOV lane is marked with a diamond symbol and the words Carpool Lane. Do not cross over double solid lines to enter or exit an HOV lane. Use designated entrances and exits.\nCenter Left Turn Lanes\n:A center left turn lane is located in the middle of a two-way street. It is marked on both sides by two painted lines. The inner line is broken and the outer line is solid. Use the center left turn lane to prepare for and make a left turn or U-turn. It is not a regular traffic lane or passing lane. You may only drive for 200 feet in the center left turn lane. To turn left \nfrom this lane\n\u2022 Look for other vehicles coming toward you in the center left turn lane.\n\u2022 Signal.\n\u2022 Look over your shoulder to check your blind spots. \n\u2022 Merge completely into the center", "doc_id": "cbf84c14-ed2e-401e-b2de-d52270f0d239", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f1314919421d6cfaf2eacb8fee6be64bcfb75909323d41a385a77259051ff628", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 30785, "end": 34640}, "relationships": {"1": "a9afbd2d-471f-4978-8e60-ce0e3252396f", "2": "f79ad173-fae5-40d3-ae4a-4fa51917b726", "3": "e23ba097-c418-4651-9cc6-aef479955c4b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e23ba097-c418-4651-9cc6-aef479955c4b": {"__data__": {"text": "road surface in a HOV lane is marked with a diamond symbol and the words Carpool Lane.

Merge into these areas or lanes to allow cars behind you to pass. \nYou must use a turnout area or lane to let other vehicles \npass when you are driving slowly on a two-lane road, where passing is unsafe, and there are five or more vehicles following you.\nBIKE\nLANEBIKE\nLANE\n19Bicycle Lanes\nBicycle lanes are for bicyclists only and run alongside vehicle traffic. \nThey are typically marked by a single solid white line and signs. They are sometimes painted bright green to make them easier to see. \nIt is illegal to drive in a bicycle lane unless you are:\n\u2022 Parking (where permitted).\n\u2022 Entering or leaving the road.\n\u2022 Turning (within 200 feet of an intersection). \nThere are multiple types of bike lanes and markings:\n\u2022 Bike lane:  Established along streets adjacent to vehicle traffic.  \nTypically marked by a single solid white line that turns into a dash-line \nnear an intersection.\n\u2022 Buffered bike lane:  Uses chevrons or diagonal markings to provide \ngreater separation from traffic and on-street parking.\n\u2022 Bike route:  Uses bike route signs and shared road markings to \ndesignate a preferred route for bicyclists on streets shared with vehicle traffic. \n\u2022 Bicycle boulevard:  Prioritizes bicycle travel on streets shared with \nvehicle traffic. \n\u2022 Separated bikeway:  Is physically separated from motor vehicle traffic \nand for exclusive use of bicyclists. They are also known as a cycle track or protected bike lanes. The separation may include flexible posts, grade separation, inflexible barriers, or on-street parking.\n\u2022 Shared roadway bicycle markings: Alert drivers that bicyclists can occupy the lane and help bicyclists maintain a safe lane position in traffic.\nNOTE:  Check your blind spots before entering \na bike lane. If you drive a motorized bicycle, use caution to avoid other bicyclists. Travel at a reasonable speed and do not endanger the \nsafety of other bicyclists .3 FEETSHARE THE ROADSHARROWS\nExample of shared roadway.\n20Turns\nRight Turns\nTo make a right turn:  \n\u2022 Drive close to the right edge of the \nroad. \n \u2014If a designated right turn lane is available, enter at the opening. \n \u2014You can drive in a bike lane within 200 feet from the turn. Check for bicyclists in your blind spots.\n\u2022 Watch for pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists between your vehicle and the curb. \n\u2022 Start signaling about 100 feet before the turn. \n\u2022 Look over your right shoulder and reduce your speed. \n\u2022 Stop behind the limit line. A limit line is a wide white line that shows the drivers where to stop before an intersection or crosswalk. If there is no limit line, stop before you enter the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, stop before you enter the intersection. \n\u2022 Look both ways (left-right-left) and turn when it is safe. \n\u2022 Complete your turn in the right lane.

Follow the same steps listed above for right turns. \nRight Turn Against a Red Arrow\nYou may not turn right if you are stopped at a red arrow light. Wait until the light changes to green before making your turn.\nRight Turn at a Public Transit Bus Lane\nIt is illegal to drive, stop, park, or leave a vehicle in an area designated for public transit buses. Signs will be posted to indicate the lanes are for bus only use. However, you may cross a bus lane to make a right turn.\nExample of a right turn.\n21Right Turn onto a Road with a Dedicated Lane\nA dedicated right turn lane does not \nmerge into another lane and allows you to make a right turn without stopping. You may make your turn even if there is a red light for vehicles going straight through the intersection. If there is a traffic light or sign on the right curb of the right turn lane, you must obey that light or sign. Always yield to pedestrians in a crosswalk when turning.\nLeft Turns\nTo turn left:\n\u2022 Drive close to the center divider or into the left turn lane.\n \u2014Enter a designated left turn lane at the opening. Do not cross any solid line.\n \u2014Enter a two-way center left turn lane within 200 feet of the turn. Respect the right-of-way of any vehicle, bicyclist, or motorcyclist already in the lane. Always yield to pedestrians.\n\u2022 Start signaling 100 feet before the turn.\n\u2022 Look over your left shoulder and reduce your speed.\n\u2022 Stop behind the limit line. If there is no limit line, stop before you enter the crosswalk. If there is no crosswalk, stop before you enter the intersection.\n\u2022 Look both ways (left-right-left) and begin your turn when it is safe.\n\u2022 Proceed into the intersection while turning to complete your turn in the left lane. \n\u2022 Do not turn the steering wheel too soon and enter the lane of oncoming vehicles. \n \u2014Keep your wheels pointed straight ahead until it is safe to start your turn. If your wheels are pointed to the left and a vehicle hits you from behind, you could be pushed into oncoming traffic. \n\u2022 Accelerate smoothly during and after the turn. \n\u2022 Allow the steering wheel to straighten in the new lane.\nExample of a left turn.\n22Left Turn Against a Red Light\nYou may turn left against a red light when you are turning from a one-\nway street onto a one-way street. Make sure there is no sign prohibiting \nthe turn. Yield to other vehicles, pedestrians, or bicyclists who have a \ngreen light. Look both ways and turn when it is safe.\nU-turns\nA U-turn is when you turn your vehicle around to go back in the direction \nyou came. To make a U-turn, signal and use the left turn lane or far-left \nlane. You may make a U-turn:\n\u2022 Across a double yellow line.\n\u2022 In a residential district if no vehicles are approaching you within 200 \nfeet.\n\u2022 At an intersection on a green traffic light or green arrow, unless a No \nU-turn sign is posted.\n\u2022 On a divided highway if a center divider opening is provided.\nNever make a U-turn:\n\u2022 Where a No U-turn sign is posted. \n\u2022 At or on a railroad crossing.\n\u2022 On a divided highway by crossing a dividing section, curb, strip of \nland, or two sets of double yellow lines.\n\u2022 When you", "doc_id": "0c0009e4-0786-4285-b244-715e578d8f12", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ad0926ca21053d10837faa5094573dac60bf536dd39712de8a8fafafd33efb12", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 38520, "end": 42418}, "relationships": {"1": "a9afbd2d-471f-4978-8e60-ce0e3252396f", "2": "e23ba097-c418-4651-9cc6-aef479955c4b", "3": "71666235-3b39-4199-8c02-1a37e4f2d2b8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "71666235-3b39-4199-8c02-1a37e4f2d2b8": {"__data__": {"text": "U-turn is when you turn your vehicle around to go back in the direction \nyou came.

Watch for pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles between your vehicle and the curb.  When making turns, there may be signs or arrows \nthat indicate you can turn from or end in more than one lane.\n1. Left turn from a two-way street . \nS\ntart the turn in the left lane \nclosest to the middle of the street. To reduce the risk of collision, end the turn in the left lane closest to the middle of the street going in your vehicle\u2019s direction. \n2. Right turn . Begin and end the \nt\nurn in the lane closest to the right \nedge of the road. Do not swing wide into another lane of traffic. \n3. Left turn from a two-way street onto a one-way street . S\ntart the \nturn from the lane closest to the middle of the street (far-left lane). If there are three or more lanes in your direction of travel, you may end your turn in any lane that is open.\n4. Left turn from a one-way street onto a two-way street . S\ntart \nthe turn from the far-left lane. To reduce the risk of collision, end the turn in the left lane closest to the middle of the street going in your vehicle\u2019s direction. \n11\n2\n3\n43\n245. Left turn from a one-way street onto a  \none-way street . Start the turn from the  \nfar-left lane. Bicyclists can legally use the \nleft turn lane for their left turns. If there are three or more lanes in your direction of travel, you may end your turn in any lane that is open.\n6. Right turn from a one-way street onto a \none-way street . Start the turn in the \nfar-right lane. If safe, you may end the turn in any lane.  \n7. Turn at a \u201cT\u201d intersection from  \na one-way street onto a two-way \nstreet . Traffic going straight through \nthe intersection has the right-of-way. You may turn either right or left from the center lane. \nBraking\n\u2022 Remove your foot from the gas pedal (accelerator) and allow the vehicle to slow down. Lightly press the brake until you come to a full stop. Give yourself enough space and time to perform this maneuver.\n\u2022 When stopping at a limit line, do not cross over the line.

If you need to cross \nseveral lanes, signal and cross them one at a time. Check your blind \nspots for vehicles, motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians each time.\nExiting\nTo exit a highway safely:\n\u2022 Know your exit and be aware of when it is approaching.\n\u2022 If you plan to change lanes, do so one at a time. Signal and look over \nyour shoulder to check your blind spots.\n\u2022 When in the proper lane, signal five seconds (approximately 400 feet) \nbefore you exit.\n\u2022 Make sure you are at a safe speed to exit.\n\u2022 Do not cross over any solid lines when exiting.\n26Crossing or Entering Traffic\nWhen entering traffic from a full stop, signal and leave a large enough \nspace to get up to the speed of traffic. To merge, enter, or exit traffic, you \nneed a space that is: \n\u2022 Half a block on city streets, which is about 150 feet. \n\u2022 A full block on the highway, which is about 300 feet. \n\u2022 Even if you have a green light, do not start across the intersection if \nthere are pedestrians or vehicles blocking your pathway.\nWhen turning left, do not assume that an oncoming vehicle with its right \nturn signal on is turning before it reaches you. The driver may have their \nsignal on by mistake or plan to turn just beyond you. Wait for the vehicle \nto start its turn before beginning the left turn. \nPassing\nYou must judge whether you have enough space to pass whenever you \napproach: \n\u2022 An oncoming vehicle or bicyclist.\n\u2022 A hill, curve, intersection, or road obstruction. To safely pass, the hill or \ncurve should be at least one-third of a mile ahead.\nBefore you pass, look ahead for road conditions that may cause other \nvehicles to move into your lane.\nDo not pass:\n\u2022 If you are approaching a hill or curve and cannot see if other traffic is \napproaching. This is very dangerous on one and two lane roads.\n\u2022 Within 100 feet of an intersection, bridge, tunnel, railroad crossing, or \nother hazardous area. \n\u2022 At crossroads and driveways. \n\u2022 Unless you have enough space to return to your lane.\n27How to Pass\nWhen you are going to pass on an open highway:\n\u2022 Signal that you plan on passing.\n\u2022 Look over your shoulder to check your blind spots.\n\u2022 Drive into the passing lane.\n\u2022 Speed up to pass the vehicle.\n\u2022 Signal and return to your original lane.\nYou may pass on the right only when:\n\u2022 An open highway has two or more lanes going in your direction.\n\u2022 The driver ahead of you is turning left and you can safely pass on the \nright. Never pass on the left if the driver is signaling a left turn. \n\u2022 You are on a one-way street.\nNever drive off the paved or main-traveled part of the road to pass.\nBeing Passed\nIf a vehicle is passing you or signals that they plan on passing, allow the \nvehicle to pass.

Look for a space at least three feet longer than your vehicle. When you find a space, turn on your signal to show that you plan on parking.\n2. Pull up alongside the vehicle in front of the space. Leave about two feet between \nyour vehicle and the vehicle next to you. Stop once your rear bumper is aligned with the front of your parking space. Keep your signal on.\n3. Check your blind spots . Look in your \nrearview mirror and over your shoulder for approaching vehicles and pedestrians.\n4. Begin backing up . Turn your steering \nwheel to back into the space at about a 45-degree angle.\n5. Straighten out. Begin turning the steering wheel away from the curb when your rear wheel is within 18 inches of the curb. You may need to pull forward and backward to straighten out. Your vehicle should now be parallel and within 18 inches of the curb. \n6. Parking . Turn off your vehicle and set the \nparking brake. Before you exit your vehicle, look carefully for passing vehicles, bicycles, and motorcycles. Exit when safe.45\u00b0 \n29Straight Line Backing \nTo back up in a straight line:\n1. Traffic check. Observe traffic and check appropriate blind spots.\n2. Signal. Activate the turn signal before pulling up to the curb. Cancel \nthe turn signal once completed.\n3. Check your blind spots. Look in your rearview mirror and over your \nshoulder for approaching vehicles and pedestrians. \n4. Begin backing up. Back in a straight line for three vehicle lengths \nwhile remaining within three feet of the curb. Stay aware of what is \nbehind you when backing up. \n5. Control. To maintain control of the vehicle, back at a smooth, safe \nspeed and adjust the steering wheel when needed. Practice until \nyou can keep the vehicle straight. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to pull away \nfrom the curb.\nParking on a Hill\nWhen you park on a hill, your vehicle could roll due to equipment failure. \nRemember to set the parking brake and leave the vehicle in park, or in \ngear for manual transmission.

The reason for the stop \nmust be documented on the citation issued or law enforcement report \ncompleted.\nYour Rights During the Enforcement Stop \nIf an officer asks your permission to do something, you have a right to \nsay no. However, if you say no and the officer says they are going to do it \nanyway, you do not have a right to interfere with their actions. For example, \nan officer may request to search part or all of your vehicle. You have a \nright to decline that request, but the officer may have the legal authority \nto search your vehicle anyway under certain circumstances. If you do not \nwant the officer to search your vehicle, you should clearly say that you do \nnot give your permission, but you do not have a right to resist or obstruct \nthe officer if they search your vehicle anyway.\nThe driver of a stopped vehicle must produce a driver\u2019s license, \nproof of insurance, and vehicle registration when stopped by law \nenforcement. If a driver does not produce these documents, officers \nmay conduct a limited search for them. An officer may also request the \nnames or identification of passengers. Passengers can decline that \nrequest, but under some circumstances the passengers may be required \nto identify themselves anyway. If passengers do not want to produce their \nidentification, they should clearly say so. Passengers should not interfere \nwith the officer\u2019s duties in conducting the traffic stop, and if an officer \ndemands identification, passengers should not interfere with the officer\u2019s \nactions. During a traffic stop, an officer can legally require the driver and \nall passengers to exit or stay inside the vehicle. If you are told to exit the \nvehicle or stay inside, you must do so.\nIn California, only federal law enforcement officers can ask you about \nyour immigration status. California law prohibits state and local officers \nfrom asking drivers or passengers about their immigration status. If a \nCalifornia law enforcement officer asks you about your immigration status, \nyou can decline to answer.\n33In general, the First Amendment protects the right of drivers and \npassengers to record interactions with law enforcement in public spaces. If you are recording, you should immediately make that clear. \nYou do not have a right to interfere with the officer\u2019s lawful duties during the enforcement stop, and you should not reach into concealed areas to retrieve your recording device without the officer\u2019s permission. If your recording is not interfering with the officer\u2019s ability to lawfully do their job, an officer cannot confiscate your recording device, delete the recording, or destroy the device just because you are using it to record. In general, you also have the right to deny a request to unlock a cellular phone or provide a password to it, though under some circumstances, such as if you are on parole, you may have to give permission in response to such requests. Finally, no government employee can retaliate against you just because you recorded something in public.\nEven if you believe your rights were violated, you should not engage \nin physical resistance or violence against the officer. If an officer does something that you believe violates your rights, you can voice your objection, but you should not physically resist. Everyone has the right to be safe during a traffic stop.

Laws and Rules of the Road\nTraffic Control\nWhen at or approaching traffic signals or signs, yield to pedestrians, \nbicyclists, and other nearby vehicles that may have the right-of-way. See Right of Way Rules: Who Goes First, in this section.\nTraffic Signals\nSolid Red Light \nA red traffic signal light means STOP. You can turn right at a red light, if:\n\u2022 There is not a NO TURN ON RED sign posted.\n\u2022 You stop at the stop or limit line, yield for pedestrians, and turn when it is safe.\nRed Arrow\nA red arrow means STOP. Do not turn at a red arrow. Remain stopped until a green traffic signal light or green arrow appears. \nFlashing Red Light\nA flashing red signal light means STOP. After stopping, you may go when it is safe. \nSolid Yellow Light\nA yellow traffic signal light means CAUTION. The light is about to turn red. When you see a yellow traffic signal light, stop, if you can do so safely. If you cannot stop safely, cautiously cross the intersection.\nYellow Arrow\nA yellow arrow means the protected turning time is ending. The signal will change soon. If you cannot stop safely or you are already in the intersection, cautiously complete your turn. Pay attention to the next signal. It could be a:\n\u2022 Green or red traffic signal light.\n\u2022 Red arrow.\n\n36Flashing Yellow Light\nA flashing yellow traffic signal light is a warning to PROCEED \nWITH CAUTION. Slow down and be alert. You do not need to \nstop.\nFlashing Yellow Arrow\nYou can turn, but your turn is not protected from other traffic.  \nProceed to turn left after yielding to oncoming traffic and \nproceed with caution.\nSolid Green Light\nA green traffic signal light means GO. You should still stop for \nany vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian in the intersection. Only \nproceed if you have enough space without creating a danger to \nany oncoming vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian. Do not enter the \nintersection if you cannot get completely across before the traffic \nsignal light turns red.\nGreen Arrow\nA green arrow means GO in the direction the arrow is pointing. \nThe green arrow allows you to make a protected turn. \nOncoming vehicles are stopped by a red traffic signal light. \nTraffic Light Not Working\nWhen a traffic light is not working, stop as if the intersection \nis controlled by STOP signs in all directions.

The vehicle that arrives to the intersection first has the right-of-way. Other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians must wait for the person who has the right-of-way. Never assume that other drivers will give you the right-of-way. Give up your right-of-way when it will help prevent collisions.\nIntersections\nAn intersection is any place where one road meets another road. Controlled intersections have signs or traffic signal lights. Uncontrolled and blind intersections do not. Before entering an intersection, check for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Be prepared to slow down and stop if necessary. Pedestrians always have the right-of-way. Here are some right-of-way rules at intersections:\n\u2022 Without STOP or YIELD signs:  The vehicle that arrives to the \nintersection first has the right-of-way. However, if a vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist gets to the intersection at the same time as you, give the right-of-way to the vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist on your right. If you approach a stop sign and there is a stop sign on all four corners, stop first and proceed as above.\n\u2022 T intersections without STOP or YIELD signs:  Vehicles, bicyclists, \nand pedestrians on the through road (continuing to go straight) have the right-of-way.\n\u2022 Turning left:  Check for pedestrians. Give the right-of-way to any \npedestrian or approaching vehicle that is close enough to be dangerous. \n\u2022 Turning right:  Always check for pedestrians crossing the street, and \nmotorcycles and bicycles riding next to you.\n\u2022 Green traffic signal light: Proceed with caution. Pedestrians have the right-of-way. \n\u2022 Entering traffic:  When entering traffic, you must proceed with \ncaution and yield to the traffic already occupying the lanes. It is against the law to stop or block an intersection where there is not enough space to completely cross before the traffic signal light turns red. \n42Roundabouts\nIn a roundabout, traffic travels in one direction around a central island. \nHow to use a roundabout:\n1. Slow down as you approach.\n2. Yield to all traffic already in the roundabout.\n3. Enter heading to the right when there is a big enough gap in traffic to \nmerge safely.\n4. Watch for signs and lane markings that guide you.\n5. Travel in a counter-clockwise direction. Do not stop or pass.\n6. Signal when you change lanes or exit.\n7.

If you miss your exit, continue around until you return to your exit.\nIf the roundabout has multiple lanes, choose your entry or exit lane based on your destination. This is shown in the image below. To:\n1. Turn right (yellow car): Choose the right lane and exit in the right lane.\n2. Go straight (red car): Choose either lane. Exit in the lane you entered.\n3. Turn left: Enter and continue driving until you reach the exit in the direction you choose (blue car).\nRoundabout Examples\nRight Turn Straight Left Turn\n43Pedestrians\nThese are considered pedestrians or vulnerable road users:\n\u2022 A person walking.\n\u2022 A person traveling on something other than a vehicle or bicycle. This \nincludes roller skates, a skateboard, etc.\n\u2022 A person with a disability  using a tricycle, quadricycle, or wheelchair \nfor transportation.\nTricycle\n Quadricycle\n Standard \nWheelchair\nElectric \nWheelchair\nAlthough pedestrians have the right-of-way, they also must follow the rules of the road.\nWhen there is a pedestrian crossing a roadway with or without a \ncrosswalk, you must  use caution, reduce your speed, or stop to allow the \npedestrian to safely finish crossing. \nOther things to keep in mind:\n\u2022 Do not pass a vehicle stopped at a crosswalk. You may not be able to \nsee a pedestrian crossing the street.\n\u2022 If a pedestrian makes eye contact with you, they are ready to cross the street. Yield to the pedestrian.\n\u2022 Always allow pedestrians enough time to safely cross a street as some groups such as seniors, people with small children, and people with disabilities may require extra time.\nCrosswalks\nA crosswalk is the part of the road set aside for pedestrians to safely cross the road. They are often marked with white lines. School crossings may have yellow crosswalk lines. Not all crosswalks are marked. \nPedestrians have the right-of-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. If \nthere is a limit line before the crosswalk, stop at the limit line and allow pedestrians to cross the street. \nSome crosswalks have flashing lights. Whether or not the lights are \nflashing, look for pedestrians and be prepared to stop. \n44Pedestrians who are Blind\nPedestrians using guide dogs or white canes have the right-of-way at all \ntimes. These pedestrians are partially or totally blind. Be careful when you \nare turning or backing up. This is particularly important if you are driving \na hybrid or electric vehicle because blind pedestrians rely on sound to \nknow there is a vehicle nearby. \n\u2022 Do not stop in the middle of a crosswalk.

The vehicle facing \ndownhill has more control when backing up the hill. The vehicle facing \ndownhill should back up until the vehicle going uphill can pass.\nSharing the Road\nDrivers need to share the road with other vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, \nroad workers, and large vehicles. \nBlind Spots (the No Zone) \nLarge vehicle and truck drivers have a \nbetter view in front of them and bigger \nmirrors. But they also have large blind \nspots, also called No Zones. In these \nareas, your vehicle can disappear from a \nlarge vehicle or truck driver\u2019s view. If you \ncannot see the truck\u2019s side mirrors, the \ntruck driver cannot see you.\nBraking\nLarge vehicles and commercial trucks take longer to stop than \npassenger vehicles traveling at the same speed. When traveling, they \ncreate extra space in front of their vehicle to use if they need to stop \nsuddenly. The average passenger vehicle traveling at 55 mph can stop \nwithin 300 feet. A large vehicle traveling at the same speed can take up \nto 400 feet to stop. The heavier the vehicle and the faster it is moving, \nthe longer it takes to safely stop, so a loaded truck will take longer to \nTractor-Trailer\nThe shaded areas in this image \nare the truck driver\u2019s blind spots.\n45stop than an empty truck. Do not move in front of a large vehicle and \nsuddenly slow down or stop. The large vehicle will not be able to stop fast enough to avoid crashing into you.\nTurning\nWhen a vehicle turns, the rear wheels follow a shorter path than the front wheels. The longer the vehicle, the greater the difference in the length of the turning path. This is why large vehicles and truck drivers must often swing wide to complete a turn. When you follow a large vehicle, look at its turn signals before you start to pass. It may appear to be turning one direction but instead is swinging wide in the opposite direction in order to turn.\nManeuvering\nLarge vehicles and trucks are not as easy to maneuver as passenger vehicles. On a divided highway with four or more traffic lanes in one direction, they may be driven in the lane just to the left of the far-right lane. When driving near large vehicles and trucks, do not:\n\u2022 Change lanes directly in front of them to reach an exit or turn.\n\u2022 Drive next to them longer than you need to. Always pass a large vehicle on the left side. After you pass the large vehicle or truck, move ahead of it. Driving alongside a large vehicle makes it hard for the driver to avoid dangers in the road.\n\u2022 Underestimate their size and speed.\nBuses, Streetcars, Trolleys \nSafety zones are spaces set aside \nfor pedestrians waiting for buses\nstreetcars, and trolleys. Safety zones are marked by raised buttons or markers on a road. Do not drive through a safety zone under any condition. \nWhen a bus, streetcar, or trolley is \nstopped at a safety zone or traffic light, you may pass at no more than 10 mph. \nDo not overtake and pass a light rail vehicle or streetcar on the left side, \nwhether it is moving or standing, unless:\n\u2022 You are on a one-way street.\n\u2022 A traffic officer directs you to pass on the left.\nSafety Zones are marked by dotted \nwhite lines., \n46Light Rail Vehicles \nOn public roads, light rail vehicles have \nthe same rights and responsibilities as other vehicles.

To safely share the road with motorcyclists:\n\u2022 Check for motorcycles and use your mirrors when you change lanes or enter a road. Motorcycles are smaller in size and harder to see so they easily disappear in vehicle blind spots. \n\u2022 Allow a safe three-second following distance. This space will help you avoid hitting a motorcyclist if they brake suddenly or fall.\n\u2022 Whenever possible, give a motorcycle the full lane. It is legal to share lanes with motorcycles, this is known as lane splitting.\n\u2022 Never try to pass a motorcycle in the same lane as you.\n\u2022 Check for motorcyclists before you open your door next to traffic.\n\u2022 When possible, move to one side of your lane to give motorcyclists more room to pass.\nRoad conditions can cause motorcyclists to suddenly change speed or direction.\nDo not turn in front of light rail \nvehicles.\n47Emergency Vehicles\nGive the right-of-way to any \nlaw enforcement vehicle, fire engine, ambulance, or other \nemergency vehicle using a \nsiren and red lights. Failure to pull over may result in a ticket. Drive to the right edge of the road and stop until the emergency vehicle(s) have passed. \nWhen approaching a stationary emergency vehicle with flashing \nemergency signal lights (hazard lights), move over and slow down.\nIf you are in an intersection when you see an emergency vehicle, \ncontinue through the intersection. Drive to the right as soon as it is safe and stop. \nObey any direction, order, or signal given by a law enforcement officer, \nor firefighter. Follow their orders even if they conflict with existing signs, signals, or laws.\nIt is against the law to follow within 300 feet of any fire engine, law \nenforcement vehicle, ambulance, or other emergency vehicle when their siren or flashing lights are on. \nYou can be arrested if you drive to the scene of a fire, collision, or other \ndisaster. When you do this, you are getting in the way of firefighters\nambulance crews, or other rescue and emergency personnel., \nSlow-moving Vehicles\nThey can take longer to get up to speed \nwhen entering traffic.

If you see animals or livestock near the road, slow down or stop \nand proceed when it is safe. Be sure to follow directions from the person \nin charge of the animals.\nBicycles\nBicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as other drivers. \nBicyclists may:\n\u2022 Legally ride on certain sections of freeways where there is no \nalternate route and bicycling is not forbidden by law.\n\u2022 Move left to avoid hazards. These may include parked or moving \nvehicles, bicycles, animals, or trash.\n\u2022 Choose to ride near the left curb or edge of a one-way street.\n\u2022 Choose to use crosswalks by stopping and crossing as a pedestrian.\n49Bicyclist Responsibilities\nAs a bicyclist, you must:\n\u2022 Obey all traffic signs, signal lights, \nand basic right-of-way rules.\n\u2022 Ride in the same direction as traffic.\n\u2022 Always look over your shoulder to \nmake sure the lane is clear before \nturning or changing lanes. \n\u2022 Yield to pedestrians.\n\u2022 Wear a helmet (if under 18 years \nold).\n\u2022 Stay visible (for example, never \nweave between parked vehicles).\n\u2022 Ride as near to the right curb or \nedge of the roadway as possible.\n\u2022 Not ride on the sidewalk (unless \nallowed by the city).\n\u2022 Make left and right turns in the \nsame way drivers do, using hand \nsignals and turn lanes. \n\u2022 Use a bike lane, whenever possible, or use a through traffic lane.\n\u2022 Have fully functional brakes.\nBicycling at Night\nWhen it is dark out, bicyclists should avoid wearing dark clothing. Your \nbicycle must have the following equipment:\n\u2022 A front lamp with a white light visible from 300 feet.\n\u2022 A built-in rear red reflector, solid red light, or flashing red light.

Obey special signs or instructions \nfrom workers such as flaggers.\nFines and Double Fine Zones\nFines for traffic violations in a work zone can be $1,000 or more. Anyone \nconvicted of assaulting a highway worker faces fines of up to $2,000 and \nimprisonment for up to one year.\nCertain roads are chosen as Safety Enhanced-Double Fine Zones. This \nis due to increased collision-related injuries and fatalities. Fines are \ndoubled in these zones.\nFines are also doubled in highway construction or maintenance zones \nwhen workers are present.\nMove Over and Slow Down\nDrivers must move over and slow down for emergency and road work \nvehicles.

If you are stopped by a law \nenforcement officer and cited (ticketed) for a traffic violation, you sign \nthe ticket as a promise to appear in traffic court. If you get a traffic ticket \n56and fail to appear (FTA) in court, DMV may suspend your driving privilege \nuntil you appear. If you do not keep your promise to appear in court, the \nFTA goes on your driver record. \nEach time you are convicted of a moving traffic violation, the court \nnotifies DMV. The conviction is placed on your driver\u2019s record. \nConvictions reported by other states and juvenile court are also added \nto your driver\u2019s record. Traffic convictions and collisions stay on your \nrecord for 36 months or longer, depending on the type of conviction. As \nan adult, your license may be suspended if your driver\u2019s record shows \none of the following point totals:\n\u2022 4 points in 12 months.\n\u2022 6 points in 24 months.\n\u2022 8 points in 36 months.\nTraffic Violator School\nIf you are given a one-point traffic violation, the judge may offer you the \nchoice to attend a traffic violator school to have the citation not reported \nto your insurance company but remain on your driving record. You can \ndo this once in any 18-month period. The school will report your course \ncompletion to the court. You will also get a completion receipt. \nIf you are a commercial driver cited in a noncommercial vehicle, see the \nCalifornia Commercial Driver Handbook .\nSuspension or Revocation\nIf you have too many points on your driver\u2019s record, you will be \nconsidered a negligent driver. DMV will place you on probation, suspend, \nor revoke your driving privilege. When this happens, you have the right to \na hearing. DMV will notify you in writing of any action taken against your \ndriving privilege and inform you of your legal rights, including your right \nto a hearing. \nDMV will revoke your driving privilege if you are convicted of a hit-\nand-run or reckless driving that resulted in injury. Courts also have the \nauthority to suspend a person\u2019s driving privilege.\nAt the end of your suspension or revocation, you may apply for \na replacement driver\u2019s license.

If you received \nnotification that a proposed action is being taken against your driving \nprivilege, you must request a hearing within 10 days of being served or \n14 days from the date the notice is mailed. If you do not make a timely \nrequest, your right to a hearing will be lost. \nThis hearing provides you with an opportunity to be heard before an \naction is taken against your driving privilege. You may also have to \nappear in court for the same reason. Any action taken by the court is \nindependent of the action taken by DMV. \n58Your Hearing Rights \nYou have the right to: \n\u2022 Present relevant evidence and witnesses on your behalf. \n\u2022 Testify on your behalf or be represented by an attorney or other \nrepresentative at your expense. Representation by an attorney is not \nrequired. \n\u2022 Review the evidence and cross examine the testimony of any witness. DMV bases its case only on written documents.

You will not have enough time to \nreact if the driver in front of you brakes suddenly. Use the three-second \nrule to ensure a safe following distance and avoid a collision. Following \nother vehicles at a safe distance gives you enough time to react if \nanother driver makes a mistake.\nIf a vehicle merges in front of you too closely, take your foot off the \naccelerator. This creates space between you and the vehicle ahead. \nCreate more space in front of your vehicle when:\n\u2022 A tailgater is behind you. Maintain your course and speed. Then, \nwhen safe to do so, merge right to change into another lane and allow \nthe tailgater to pass. \n\u2022 Following motorcyclists on metal surfaces (bridge gratings, railroad \ntracks, etc.), and gravel.\n61Know What is At Your Side\nBe aware of what is on each side of you. To maintain enough space to \nmaneuver safely and react to other drivers: \n\u2022 Do not stay in another driver\u2019s blind spot.\n\u2022 Avoid driving directly alongside other vehicles. \n\u2022 Make space for vehicles entering freeways, even if you have the right-of-way. Be ready for rapid changes and watch for signals from other drivers.\n\u2022 Keep space between your vehicle and parked vehicles. \n\u2022 Look both ways, even at intersections where traffic has a red light or stop sign.\nBlind Spots\nEvery vehicle has blind spots. These are areas around the vehicle that a driver cannot see when looking straight ahead or using the mirrors. For most vehicles, the blinds spots are at \nthe sides slightly behind the driver. \nTo check your blind spots, look over your right and left shoulders out of your side windows. Only turn your head when you look. Do not turn your whole body or steering wheel. Check your blind spots before you:\n\u2022 Change lanes.\n\u2022 Turn at an intersection.\n\u2022 Merge with traffic.\n\u2022 Back up.\n\u2022 Leave a parking space.\n\u2022 Parallel park.\n\u2022 Pull out from the curb.\n\u2022 Open your car door.\nThe shaded areas are your blind \nspots., \n62Know What is Behind You\nKnowing what is behind you can help you avoid rear-end collisions. \nCheck traffic behind you often by using your rearview mirror, side mirrors, \nand turning your head:\n\u2022 Change lanes. \n\u2022 Check your blind spots.\n\u2022 Reduce your speed.\n\u2022 Turn into a side road or driveway.\n\u2022 Stop to pull into a parking space.\n\u2022 Pull up to and away from the curb.\n\u2022 Back up.\nUnderstand the Road Conditions\nDarkness\nWhen driving at night, make sure you can stop in the distance lit by your \nheadlights.

You may have difficulty seeing them.\n\u2022 Try to avoid driving during sunrise and sunset.\nSkids\nA skid is when one or more of the tires lose traction with the road and the \nvehicle starts to slip. You may not be able to control your vehicle. There \nare a few different types of skids.\nSlippery Surface Skids\nIce and packed snow on the road can cause your vehicle to skid. This is \neven more likely if you are driving too fast or going downhill. Drive slowly \nand leave space between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead of you. To \nprevent skidding on slippery surfaces:\n\u2022 Slow down as you approach intersections and curves. For sharp \ncurves, slow down as you approach and move through. \n\u2022 Avoid fast turns and quick stops.\n\u2022 Shift to low gear before going down a steep hill.\n\u2022 Avoid areas like ice patches, wet leaves, oil, or standing water.\nIf you start to skid, follow these steps:\n1. Slowly remove your foot from the accelerator.\n2. Do not use the brakes.\n3. Turn the steering wheel in the direction of the skid.\n4. Try to get a wheel on dry pavement.\nLocked Wheel Skids\nA locked wheel skid is usually caused by braking too hard when you are \ngoing too fast. If this happens, your vehicle will skid no matter which way \nthe steering wheel is turned. To get out of a locked wheel skid if your \nvehicle is equipped with: \n\u2022 Four-wheel antilock braking system (ABS), apply firm pressure on the \nbrake pedal.\n\u2022 Rear-wheel ABS (common in light trucks):\n64 \u2014Ease up on the brake pedal while maintaining just enough \npressure to allow the front wheels to roll again so you can steer.\n \u2014Stop braking and turn the steering wheel into the direction of the \nskid.\n\u2022 Front-wheel ABS, remove your foot from the brake pedal to unlock \nthe wheels. Steer in the direction you want to go and straighten the \nfront wheels as the vehicle begins to straighten out.\nNOTE : To determine if your vehicle has ABS, refer to the vehicle owner\u2019s \nmanual. \nIf your vehicle is not equipped with ABS and begins to skid, quickly pump \nyour brakes until you are at a safe speed.

If you:\n\u2022 Press the brake pedal and it sinks to the floor, quickly pump the \nbrakes by gently applying and releasing pressure on your brake pedal. \n\u2022 Pump the brakes, down shift your vehicle into a lower or neutral gear \nto slow down. Then try using your emergency brake to stop.\nIf your brakes get wet, you can dry them by lightly pressing the \naccelerator and brake pedals at the same time. Only do this until the \nbrakes dry.\nSlippery Roads\nRain, snow, or mud can make the roads slippery. Drive more slowly than \nyou would on a dry road. Adjust your speed for different conditions:\n\u2022 Wet road:  Reduce your speed by 5 to 10 mph.\n\u2022 Packed snow:  Reduce your speed by half.\n\u2022 Ice: Reduce your speed to no more than 5 mph.\nSome road surfaces are more slippery than others when wet. These \nusually have warning signs posted. Here are situations where the road \nmay be more slippery:\n\u2022 Shade from trees or buildings can hide icy spots on cold, wet days. \nThese areas freeze first and dry out last.\n\u2022 Bridges and overpasses tend to freeze before the rest of the road. \nThey can have icy spots.\n\u2022 When it starts to rain, the pavement can be very slippery. \nSlow down at the first sign of rain, drizzle, or snow on the road. This is \nespecially true if it has been dry for some time because oil and dust on \nthe road\u2019s surface have not been washed away.\n65Turn on your windshield wipers, low-beam headlights, and defroster. In \na heavy rainstorm or snowstorm, you may not be able to see more than \n100 feet in front of your vehicle. If you cannot see farther than 100 feet, \nit is not safe to drive faster than 30 mph. You may have to stop from time \nto time to wipe mud or snow off your windshield, headlights, and taillights. \nIf you drive in snowy areas, carry snow chains for your tires. Snow chains \ngive your tires more traction. Carry the correct number and type of \nchains for your vehicle.\nHydroplaning\nHydroplaning occurs when driving in wet or rainy conditions. \nHydroplaning is a vehicle riding on water because the tires lose all \ncontact with the road. A slight change of direction, applying the \nbrakes, or a gust of wind could throw the vehicle into a skid. To avoid \nhydroplaning:\n\u2022 Drive slowly.\n\u2022 Steer around standing water, if possible.\n\u2022 Slow down if you hear sloshing sounds from the tires.\n\u2022 Slow down when changing lanes or direction.\nIf your vehicle starts to hydroplane:\n\u2022 Slow down gradually.\n\u2022 Do not use the brakes. Sudden braking may cause you to lose control \nof your vehicle.\nStuck in Snow or Mud\nIf stuck in the snow or mud, follow these steps:\n1. Shift into a low gear and keep the front wheels straight.\n2. Gently step on the accelerator. Avoid spinning the wheels.\n3. Drive slowly forward as far as possible.\n4. Shift into reverse and slowly back up as far as possible. Do not spin \nthe wheels.\n5. Shift into a low gear again and drive forward.\n6.

This can happen \ngradually or suddenly. It is important to understand the dangers of water \non the road, including:\n\u2022 Being swept off the road.\n\u2022 Floating debris and unseen hazards.\n\u2022 The road collapsing.\n\u2022 Vehicle malfunction.\n\u2022 Electrocution if there are fallen power lines.\nIt may not be possible to determine the depth of the flood by looking. \nIf the water is deep, the road may be too dangerous to cross. It is best \nto find another route. If you have no other option but to drive through a \nflooded road, drive slowly. After you make it through the water, test your \nbrakes to make sure they work correctly.\nHigh Winds\nHigh winds can be a hazard while driving. This is especially true for larger \nvehicles such as trucks, campers, and vehicles with trailers. When driving \nin high winds:\n\u2022 Reduce your speed. This gives you better control over your vehicle. \nYou will have more time to react if your vehicle gets hit by a strong \ngust of wind.\n\u2022 Maintain a firm hand position on the steering wheel. Strong wind \ngusts are unpredictable. If you are not holding the wheel properly \nand a gust hits, you can lose control of the vehicle.\n\u2022 Be alert. Look ahead and watch for any debris on the road. Give \nyourself enough time to react to road hazards.\n\u2022 Do not use cruise control. Maintain maximum control of the \naccelerator if a gust occurs.\n\u2022 Be proactive. It may be safer to pull over and wait for the storm to \npass.\n67Fog or Heavy Smoke\nIt is best to avoid driving in heavy fog or smoke. Consider postponing \nyour trip until the fog clears. If you must drive in heavy fog or smoke:\n\u2022 Drive slowly.\n\u2022 Use your low-beam headlights. High-beam headlights will reflect back \nand cause glare.\n\u2022 Never drive using only your parking or fog lights.\n\u2022 Make sure you can stop within the space you can see ahead. \n\u2022 Increase your following distance. \n\u2022 Use your windshield wipers and defroster as necessary.\n\u2022 Avoid crossing lanes or passing traffic unless absolutely necessary. \n\u2022 Listen for traffic you cannot see. \nIf the fog becomes too thick to drive safely, consider pulling off the road. \nActivate your emergency flashers and wait for conditions to improve.\nLaw Enforcement Traffic Breaks\nDuring a traffic break, the officer turns on their emergency lights and \nslowly weaves across lanes. Law enforcement uses traffic breaks to:\n\u2022 Slow or stop traffic to remove hazards from the road.\n\u2022 Slow or stop traffic during heavy fog or unusual traffic conditions.\n\u2022 Prevent collisions during unusual conditions.\nYou should:\n\u2022 Turn on your emergency flashers to warn other drivers.\n\u2022 Slowly decrease your speed to the same speed as the officer. Do \nnot brake suddenly unless necessary to avoid a collision. Keep a safe \ndistance from the patrol vehicle ahead of you.\n\u2022 Not drive past the patrol vehicle.

Do not speed up until the officer \nturns off their emergency lights and traffic conditions allow you to \nreturn to your normal speed.\n68Protect Yourself and Your Passengers\nSeat Belts\nYou and your passengers must wear seat \nbelts. You can get a ticket if you do not. \nIf your passenger is under 16 years old, \nyou can also get a ticket if they are not \nwearing their seat belt.\nWearing the lap belt and shoulder \nharness of a seat belt will increase your \nchance of survival in most types of \ncollisions. This image shows what can \nhappen in a collision.\nWhen you are in a collision, your vehicle \nstops. But you keep moving at the same \nspeed you were traveling. You only stop \nwhen you hit the dashboard or windshield. \nIf you are struck from the side, the impact \ncould push you back and forth across the \nseat. Seat and shoulder belts keep you \nin a better position to control the vehicle. \nThey may also minimize serious injuries.\nIt is important to wear the seat belt correctly to avoid injury or death:\n\u2022 Wear the shoulder harness across your shoulder and chest. There \nshould be little to no slack. Do not wear the shoulder belt under your \narm or behind your back. \n\u2022 Adjust the lap belt so that it is snug and lies low across your hips. \nOtherwise you might slide out of the belt in a crash. \n\u2022 If you are pregnant, wear the lap belt as low as possible under your \nabdomen. Place the shoulder strap between your breasts and to the \nside of your abdomen\u2019s bulge.IMPACT - If the red arrow \nwere another car hitting your \ncar on the driver\u2019s side:\n1. You would first be thrown \nagainst the driver\u2019s side door,\n2. Then you would \u201crebound\u201d \nand be thrown toward the \npassenger\u2019s side door.\n\n69Child Restraint System and Safety Seats\nYou must secure children with a federally-approved child passenger \nrestraint system or safety belt. The requirements depend on the child\u2019s \nheight and age.\n\u2022 Children who are under 2 years old, under 40 pounds, and \nunder 3 feet 4 inches tall:  Secure in a rear-facing child passenger \nrestraint system. \nNOTE:  A child in a rear-facing child passenger restraint system may not \nride in the front seat of an airbag-equipped vehicle.\n\u2022 Children who are under 8 years old, or who are less than 4 feet \n9 inches tall:  Secure in a child passenger restraint system in a rear \nseat. In some cases, children under 8 years old may ride in the front \nseat of a vehicle in a federally-approved child passenger restraint \nsystem. They may ride in the front seat if:\n \u2014There is no rear seat.\n \u2014The rear seats are side-facing jump seats.\n \u2014The rear seats are rear-facing seats.\n \u2014The child passenger restraint system cannot be installed properly \nin the rear seat.\n \u2014All rear seats are already occupied by children 7 years old or \nyounger.\n \u2014Medical reasons prevent the child from riding in the back seat.\n\u2022 Children who are 8 years old or older, or at least 4 feet 9 inches \ntall: May use a properly secured safety belt that meets federal \nstandards.\nYour local law enforcement agency or fire department can check the \ninstallation of your child passenger restraint system.

As your child grows, \ncheck that the child passenger restraint system is the right size.\n70Air Bags\nAir bags are a valuable safety feature on many vehicles. They can help \nkeep you safer than a seat belt alone.\nRide at least 10 inches from the airbag cover, as long as you can maintain \nfull control of your vehicle. Measure from the center of the steering \nwheel to your breastbone. Contact your vehicle dealer or manufacturer \nif you cannot safely sit 10 inches away from the air bag. They may have \nadvice about additional ways to move back from your air bag. Passengers \nshould also sit at least 10 inches away from the passenger-side air bag.\nNOTE:  Children seated next to a side air bag may be at risk of serious or \nfatal injury.\nUnattended Children and Pets\nIt is illegal to leave a child who is six years old or younger unattended in \na vehicle. A child may be left under the supervision of a person who is at \nleast 12 years old.\nIt is dangerous and illegal to leave children or animals in a hot vehicle. \nThe temperature inside a parked vehicle can rise rapidly when it is sitting \nin the sun. This is true even if a window is left slightly open. Too much \nexposure to heat can lead to dehydration, heat stroke, and death.\nManage Your Speed\nIn California, you may never drive faster than is safe for the current road \nconditions. This is known as the Basic Speed Law.\nMake sure you manage your speed and slow down when conditions call \nfor it. Regardless of the posted speed limit, your speed should depend \non:\n\u2022 The number of vehicles on the road.\n\u2022 The speed of other vehicles on the road.\n\u2022 The road surface: smooth, rough, graveled, wet, dry, wide, or narrow.\n\u2022 Bicyclists or pedestrians on or crossing the road.\n\u2022 Weather: rain, fog, snow, wind, or dust.\n\u2022 Traffic congestion: small changes in your driving habits can help \nreduce congestion . Avoid weaving in and out of freeway lanes. \nThere are also situations with specific speed limit laws and conditions \nwhere you should reduce your speed. Unless otherwise posted, the ideal \nmaximum speed limit on most California highways is 65 mph. It is 55 mph \non a two-lane undivided highway and for vehicles towing trailers.\n71Choose Between Hazards\nSometimes dangers will be on both sides of the road at the same time. \nFor example, parked cars to the right and oncoming cars to the left.\nIf one danger is greater than the other, give more space to the most \ndangerous situation. Suppose you are on a two-lane road with an \noncoming vehicle to the left and a bicyclist ahead to your right. Instead \nof driving between the vehicle and the bicyclist, take one danger at a \ntime. Slow down and let the oncoming vehicle pass. When the vehicle \nhas passed, move to the left to allow plenty of space (at least three feet) \nto pass the bicyclist. If there is a steady flow of oncoming vehicles, use as \nmuch of the left lane as you safely can to pass the bicyclist.\nKnow How to Handle Emergencies\nThere are many types of emergencies you may encounter when you \ndrive.

DO NOT remove the key from the \nignition.\n4. Let the vehicle slow to a stop, completely off the road.\n5. Fully apply the brakes when the vehicle is almost stopped.\nDriving Off the Pavement\nIf your wheels drift off the pavement:\n1. Grip the steering wheel firmly.\n2. Remove your foot from the accelerator.\n3. Brake gently.\n4. Check for traffic behind you.\n5. Carefully steer back onto the pavement.\nDo not pull or turn your steering wheel with too much force. This may \ncause you to drive into oncoming traffic.\n72Overheating Conditions\nIn extreme heat, you should:\n\u2022 Watch the temperature gauge.\n\u2022 Avoid driving at high speeds for long periods.\n\u2022 Turn off the air conditioner.\nIn extreme cold, you should:\n\u2022 Watch the temperature gauge. The engine may not have the correct \nlevel of antifreeze.\n\u2022 Use the defroster or slightly open your windows to keep them from \nfogging up. \nNOTE : See the vehicle owner\u2019s manual for more information.\nIf Your Vehicle Becomes Disabled on the Freeway\nIf your vehicle stops working on the freeway:\n1. Safely pull over to the right shoulder.\n2. Exit on the right side so you are away from traffic if you must get out \nof the vehicle.\n3. Dial 511 from your cell phone or locate call box for assistance..\n4. Return to your vehicle as soon as you can. Get back into the vehicle \nfrom the right side (away from traffic). \n5.

As you age, your tolerance \nto alcohol decreases, which increases the risk of alcohol-related driving \nproblems. The law does not see a difference between illegal drugs and \nmedications you get from a doctor or pharmacy. They can all affect your \nability to drive safely and react to what you see and hear.\nNo matter what age you are, it is illegal to drive after:\n\u2022 Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol in any form. This includes \nmedications like cough syrup.\n\u2022 Taking any drug that affects your ability to drive. This includes \nprescriptions or over-the-counter medications.\n\u2022 Using any combination of alcohol or drugs that decreases your ability \nto drive safely.\nMake sure you read medication labels and know the effects of any drug \nyou use.\u00a0 If a law enforcement officer thinks you are driving while under \nthe influence of drugs or alcohol, they have the right to ask you to take a \nblood or urine test. If you refuse to take one, DMV will suspend or revoke \nyour driving privilege.\nIMPORTANT : If you are 13 to 20 years old and convicted of operating \na bicycle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, your driving \nprivilege may be suspended or delayed for one year once you are \neligible to drive.\nUse or Possession of Alcohol or Cannabis \nProducts in a Vehicle\nThe law is very strict about carrying alcohol or cannabis products in \nyour vehicle with you. It is illegal to drink any alcohol, to smoke or eat \na cannabis product while you are driving or riding as a passenger in \na vehicle. If you are carrying any alcohol, cannabis in your vehicle, the \ncontainer must be sealed and unopened. If it is open, you must keep \nthe container in the trunk or place where passengers do not sit. It is \nalso illegal to keep an open container of alcohol in your glove box. This \nlaw does not apply if you are a passenger in a bus, taxi, camper, or \nmotorhome.\nDon\u2019t drink and drive\nWatch your speedBuckle up\nKeep both hands on the wheelAvoid distractionsSAFE Driving Tips\n78Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) Limits\nWhen you consume alcohol, traces of it enter your bloodstream. Your \nBAC measures how much alcohol is present in your bloodstream.\nIt is illegal for you to drive if you have a BAC of:\n\u2022 0.08% or higher if you are over 21 years old.\n\u2022 0.01% or higher if you are under 21 years old.\n\u2022 0.01% or higher at any age if you are on DUI probation.\n\u2022 0.04% or higher if you drive a vehicle that requires a commercial \ndriver\u2019s license. \n\u2022 0.04% or higher if you are driving a passenger for hire.\nIf you drive with an illegal BAC, a law enforcement officer can charge you with DUI. Even if your BAC is below legal limits, that does not mean it is safe for you to drive. Almost everyone feels negative effects of alcohol, even at levels lower than the legal limit. Depending on how badly you are impaired, you may be arrested and convicted of a DUI even without a BAC measurement.\nThe table below shows BAC estimates based on how many drinks are \nconsumed, gender, and body weight.

Driver Safety\nEventually, every driver will need to evaluate and assess their driving skills \nand abilities. If you are concerned about your driving, ask a trusted driver with a valid driver\u2019s license to sit in the passenger seat and observe your driving. Your observer should note any dangerous driving behaviors and give suggestions for improvement. Listen carefully and apply what you have learned. Consider professional driving lessons or driving classes as an alternative.\nReexamination\nThe Vehicle Code  allows DMV to investigate and reexamine every driver\u2019s \nability to operate a motor vehicle safely. A physical or mental condition or poor driver\u2019s record can be the basis for a reexamination, not a driver\u2019s age. Drivers with a physical or mental condition can be referred to DMV by a physician, law enforcement, or family member by submitting a completed Request for Driver Reexamination form.\nCognitive disorders, such as dementia, seizure disorder, brain tumor, \nParkinson\u2019s disease, stroke, or vertigo, present a significant challenge to safe driving. Individuals suffering from these conditions may lose their ability to drive safely.\nNOTE : When a referral or diagnosis for someone with a mild cognitive \nimpairment is received by DMV, the Driver Safety team will schedule \na reexamination. For more information regarding the reexamination process, visit dmv.ca.gov/reexamination . \nDMV may do the following:\n\u2022 Request medical information from you or your physician.\n\u2022 Conduct an in-person or over the telephone reexamination. \n\u2022 Require you to take a knowledge, vision, or driving test(s). \n\u2022 Issue you a limited term driver\u2019s license.\n\u2022 Immediately suspend or revoke your driving privilege if your physical or mental condition presents an immediate threat to public safety.\n\u2022 Take no action against your driving privilege.\n88Priority Reexamination\nIf you come in contact with law enforcement and receive a Notice \nof Priority Reexamination of Driver with a check mark in the top box\ncarefully read the form.

Restrictions may be imposed by DMV or required by law. Restrictions placed on your driving privilege will be reasonable and necessary for your safety and the safety of others. Restrictions and conditions may include: \n\u2022 Requiring a driver to place special mechanical devices on their vehicle, such as hand controls. \n\u2022 Limiting when and where a person may drive, such as no night or freeway driving. \n\u2022 Requiring eyeglasses or corrective contact lenses.\n\u2022 Requiring additional devices, such as outside mirrors.\nNOTE : There are no specific restrictions for seniors. All restrictions are \nbased on conditions, not age. \nAny restriction placed on your driver\u2019s license is based on the examiner\u2019s \nfindings and recommendations. \n89\nDriving is a privilege - NOT a right \nObey posted speed limitsWhat\u2019s the RUSH?\nSPEED KILLS\n90SECTION  13.   Seniors and Driving\nSenior drivers often have unique needs and concerns about driving. \nDriving requires certain physical, visual, and mental abilities. We all want to continue driving as long as we can. However, the time may come when we must limit or stop driving temporarily or permanently.
